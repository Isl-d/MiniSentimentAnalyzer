# MiniSentimentAnalyzer
A simple SMS sentiment analysis model using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
# MiniSentimentAnalyzer

This project is a **quick sentiment analysis** tool using **TF-IDF** and **Logistic Regression** on SMS messages (spam/ham classification).

##  Features
- Reads and processes a sample SMS dataset.
- Vectorizes text data with **TF-IDF**.
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model.
- Evaluates the model with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

##  How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model.
3. Customize or expand with your own data.

##  Files
- `SMS_sentiment_classifier.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook.
- `README.md`: This description file.

## Future Ideas
- Use a **pretrained HuggingFace BERT model** for better performance.
- Add more text preprocessing (e.g., stemming, lemmatization).
- Visualize word clouds and feature importance.
